This program shows how to rotate a Windows Metafile inside a picture box.
 It also includes a 180 angle control for selecting the rotation angle.
There are some restrictions:
1) This program only rotates WMF composed by Lines, Polylines, ellipses, points,
    polygons, polypolygons and rectangles. But you expand it for other types of figures.
2) The center point used for rotation depends on the center defined
    when the WMF is created.

You can use this technique in animation or for a graphic package.
